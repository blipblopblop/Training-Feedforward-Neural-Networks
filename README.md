# Training-Feedforward-Neural-Networks

Artificial Neural networks (ANN) are computer algorithms designed to solve problems through a process of repetitive learning. For a network to solve a problem, it must learn it by making predictions about the given data. To make the correct prediction, it must minimize the error: the difference between the target and predicted value. We formulated the research question: “can a perceptron make a prediction to produce the target output when provided a set of example data?” We investigate this question through training the network with three problems: ‘AND’, ‘OR’, and ‘XOR’. 

The data and programming code to research this question are also provided.
